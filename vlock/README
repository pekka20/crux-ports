## vlock 2.2.4 readme
This is TragicWarrior fork of vlock (https://github.com/TragicWarrior/vlock).


## About vlock screensaver plugins:
Three screensaver plugins are available, ttyblank, train and cmatrix.
The old caca screensaver plugin is removed.
The vlock-plugins manual is not updated reflecting these changes.

* ttyblank is used by default.
* ttyblank will set all monitors to 'standby' powersaving mode.
* train and cmatrix must be specified.

Two options are reseved for the wheel group:

	-n,--new
	   Switch to a new virtual console before locking all console sessions.

	-s,--disable-sysrq
	    Disable the SysRq mechanism while consoles  are  locked.
